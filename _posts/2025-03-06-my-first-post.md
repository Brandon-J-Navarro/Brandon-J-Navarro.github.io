I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-engineering-bachelors-program.html), a program designed to provide a strong foundation in modern software development and engineering principles. This degree focuses on essential areas such as scripting, programming, web development, mobile application development, user experience design, and software quality assurance.

So far, I have successfully completed coursework in scripting, Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, gaining hands-on experience in building and managing web applications, working with databases, and writing efficient scripts to automate processes.

Additionally, my program includes multiple industry-recognized certifications from AWS, CompTIA, and ITILÂ®, which allow me to develop expertise in cloud computing, IT infrastructure, and best practices in software development. These certifications enhance my qualifications and open up professional opportunities even before completing my degree.

With this growing skill set, I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world software engineering projects, contributing to innovative and high-quality software solutions.
