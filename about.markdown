Hey there! I’m a former U.S. Marine turned tech enthusiast, currently navigating the ever-evolving world of software engineering and IT infrastructure. With ten years of experience—eight in the Marine Corps and two in the professional workforce—as a System Administrator, I’ve tackled everything from network security and cloud computing to scripting automation and managing enterprise systems. Along the way, I’ve earned industry-recognized certifications (Microsoft, CompTIA, ITIL) and developed a deep passion for solving complex technical challenges.

Now, as I pursue my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I’m diving deeper into coding, mobile and web development, and software quality assurance—bridging the gap between system administration and software development. I love learning new technologies, optimizing workflows, and sharing insights on everything from cloud solutions to scripting automation.

This blog is my space to document my journey, share tech tips, and explore the intersection of IT and software development. Whether it's troubleshooting a server issue, writing PowerShell scripts, or building an application, I’m here to learn, grow, and connect with like-minded professionals.

Let’s build, break, and innovate together—one line of code at a time.
